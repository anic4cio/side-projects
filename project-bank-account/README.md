# _Bank Account - Project_ 💸
This project has been made at my beging on programing, now I refactor the whole project to Typescript, my favorite language. It's true that I'm turning all my Javascript projects to Typescript, facing issues and figure our how to do this. 
It simulates a simple cash terminal, you can enter your account and do some operations like withdraw, deposit and check your balance.

## Tools and Techs I used: 🛠️
* Node
* Typescript
* Chalk (to make terminal colored)
* Inquirer (to prompt on terminal)
* Eslint (to code style)
